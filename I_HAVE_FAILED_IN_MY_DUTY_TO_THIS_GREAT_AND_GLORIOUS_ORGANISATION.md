Dear [ INSERT LINE MANAGER ]

Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation.  

As per terms of my employment contract, I will continue to work for the next month, completing my employment on [ LAST DAY ].

I have enjoyed being part of the team but have disgraced myself by setting up and running a non-compliant repository in GitHub.  

I hope that I can rely on you to not mention this in references in the future.

Yours Sincerely,

[ YOUR NAME ]
Non-compliant Disgrace
